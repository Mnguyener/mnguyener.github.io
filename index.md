### Let's Jump into It

Hello, I am a student who has interests in the coding realms of computer science, but I'm not sure if I have the potential for it yet. However, I'm going to make it my goal to edit this page at least once every week.

### What's the Globalgiving website for?
Well, starting my junior year at my high school (which I no longer physically attend), my senior friend recruited me to join her in fundraising for Sub-Saharan communities in Africa under the guidance of a nonprofit program called *Leadership Initiatives*. It's pretty dope, but requires a lot of effort to effectively spread awareness and raise money for a country far, far away from here. Now it is my second year doing the program as a senior, and I was nominated as my new group's leader. I didn't think much of it earlier, but being the leader is really tough. I have to make sure my group members stay on task, research information, participate in our weekly calls, maintain an effort in fundraising, etc etc. Sometimes, I wanted to give up because I seriously think I'm  not cut out for a leadership role. And it's true. But, it wouldn't be fair to say that I didn't learn anything. I learned how to be more responsible and demanding towards my group when I noticed we were slacking. It helped wrap up our project for this year with satisfaction. 

### What's the fundraising about?
There are 3 categories to work on for Sub-Saharan Africa, which is actually focused on Bauchi,  Nigeria: law, business, and health. Last year, we chose business and drove our efforts into fundraising money to cover the costs for business cards, business flyers, and to support a developing business. This year, we chose health and have worked towards researching on Hygiene to create it into a well-developed brief for Nigerian officials to read. The brief includes three solutions that the health officials can consider and implement in to lessen the prevailing issues of bad hygiene. The funds will cover the costs to implement those resources.
